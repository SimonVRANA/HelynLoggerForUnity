# Helyn Logger for C# - WIP

A custom logger for Unity.

## Status
WIP

## Main goal
The main features I want for this logger are:
- filter logs using namespace, class name, and log level
- have a custom log file
- have custom log formats for console and log file
- have colors for log levels in Unity console
- use default Unity logging classes
- catch and filter all logs, including Unity native and third party
- have a Unity editor window for easier customization
- have default Unity console features: Click-to-Jump and log collapsing

Additional features that would be great to have:
- Visual context: have a "take a screenshot on critical" option, with a "number of frames" option.
- Log file name with start timestamp option
